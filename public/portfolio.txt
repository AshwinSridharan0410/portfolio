# Hi, my name is
## Ashwin Sridharan.
### I build solutions for the cloud.
I'm a Site Reliability Engineer who loves building reliable systems and making complex processes simpler. My curiosity often takes me into the world of AI — from MLOps pipelines to the latest in LLMOps — where I explore how to connect infrastructure with intelligence. For me, engineering is about resilience, creativity, and always learning something new.

##  01.About Me
Passionate about engineering highly reliable and scalable systems, I specialize in automating complex infrastructures and streamlining cloud-native operations. I thrive on solving challenging problems and transforming them into practical, innovative solutions that empower organizations to excel.
My expertise spans designing and operating resilient, self-healing platforms that seamlessly integrate across multiple cloud providers and hybrid setups, ensuring optimal performance under demanding conditions.
Some of the technologies and frameworks I actively work with include:
##  02.Where I've Worked
Johnson ControlsVirtusa
### Site Reliability Engineer- Devops @ Johnson Controls
May 2023 – Present
  * Built and operated production-grade Kubernetes clusters across GCP, Azure, AWS, and hybrid environments, ensuring high resilience and self-healing.
  * Designed and implemented a Kubernetes-native CI/CD platform using Tekton, Buildpacks, and ArgoCD, enabling automated zero-downtime deployments and efficient release management.
  * Onboarded 25+ mission-critical workloads to production using performance benchmarking, chaos testing, and load simulation for robust reliability.
  * Managed cloud infrastructure across GCP, Azure, and AWS using Terraform and Ansible, delivering consistent, disaster-recovery ready deployments via GitOps and Infrastructure as Code.
  * Automated database migrations and multiple validation steps across product teams, reducing continuous integration costs to zero by containerizing security scans with CodeQL.
  * Reduced cloud costs by 25–30% through optimization strategies including eliminating unused resources, rightsizing compute/storage, auto-shutdown policies for non-production environments, and tag-based cost governance automation.
  * Created a production-grade RAG chatbot using Azure OpenAI and vector embeddings to accelerate document access, enhancing team efficiency.
  * Developed a Flask-based internal Dev Portal for CI/CD visibility and self-service integrations with GitHub and Grafana, boosting developer productivity and transparency.
  * Implemented a comprehensive observability stack with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Alertmanager, reducing alert fatigue by 60% through fine-tuned SLIs, SLOs, and health checks.
